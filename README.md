## Getting started locally

Our application is deployed to AWS so you don't need to setup a local enviornment, but if you want to, here's how

### Make sure you have a .env file with the following structure

> REACT_APP_FIREBASE_KEY = "YOUR FB API KEY"  
>  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DOMAIN= "YOUR FB DOMAIN"  
>  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE = "YOUR FB DB URL"  
>  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID = "YOUR FB PROJECT ID"  
>  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET ="YOUR FB STORAGE BUCKEY"  
>  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_SENDER_ID = "YOUR FB SENDER ID"  
>  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID = "YOUR FB APP ID"

In the project directory, you run:

`npm install`

`npm test`

`npm start`
