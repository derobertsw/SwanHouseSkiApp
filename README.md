FaunaDB is the data API for client-serverless applications. A web-native GraphQL interface, with support for custom business logic and integration with the serverless ecosystem, enables developers to simplify code and ship faster. The underlying globally-distributed storage and compute fabric is fast, consistent, and reliable, with a modern security infrastructure.
